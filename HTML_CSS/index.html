            I completed Bachelor in EEE form RUET, BD and graduated in ECE from Concordia University, QC. 
            While I was studying in Concordia University, a course had been taken named <i style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"> COEN 6501 - Digital Design and Synthesis. </i> <br>
            To fulfill the course, there was a project work on designing and coding of 8-bit Adder circuit with VHDL programming. 
            The project title was as following:
